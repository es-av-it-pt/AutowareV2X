        booktitle = {The 2023 IEEE 97th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2023-Spring)},
        address = {Florence, Italy},
    }

It utilizes Vanetza as the protocol suite for ETSI C-ITS standards.

We have also provided a working example of a CPM application where Collective Perception Messages can be used to exchange perception information in Autoware.
