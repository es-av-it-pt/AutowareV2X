# AutowareV2X

AutowareV2X is an open-source module that can be added onto the newest Autoware.universe to enable V2X communication.

It utilizes Vanetza as the protocol suite for ETSI C-ITS standards.

We have also provided a working example of a CPM application, where Collective Perception Messages can be used to exchange perception information in Autoware.
