## About AutowareV2X

AutowareV2X is an open-source module that can be added onto the newest [Autoware.universe](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware) to enable V2X communication.

It utilizes [Vanetza](https://github.com/riebl/vanetza) as the protocol suite for ETSI C-ITS standards.

We have also provided a working example of a CPM application, where Collective Perception Messages can be used to exchange perception information in Autoware.
